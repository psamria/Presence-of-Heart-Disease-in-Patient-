## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/psamria/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Project--Presence-of-Heart-Disease-in-Patient-/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/psamria/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Project--Presence-of-Heart-Disease-in-Patient-/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# CASE STUDY REPORT 

##### Group No.: Group-11 (Section-2)
##### Student Names: Prerit Samria and Seungyeon Ko

## Executive Summary 

The goal of the case study is to find the best model to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on their medical records. There are thousands of deaths every year around the world due to heart diseases. Thus, a model to predict the presence of heart disease would be beneficial to save many lives. Similar methods could be employed to predict other prevalent diseases in the world. The data ‘Heart Disease Data Set’ has been taken from the University of California Irvine. After preprocessing the data, 5 models, namely k-NN, Naïve Bayes Classifier, Classification Trees, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network, were used. The best performance in terms of accuracy on validation data is achieved by Neural Network.
